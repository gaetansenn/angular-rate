 	icon-full = "String" (the class name of full icon, default: 'fa-star')
 	icon-half = "String" (the class name of half icon, default: 'fa-star-half-o')
 	icon-base = "String" (the class name of base icon, default: 'fa')
 	other-class = "String" (the other class to be injected for each stars)
 	readonly = "Boolean" (read only option)
 	>
 </rate>
